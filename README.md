# Aroma-chocolates-HR-Dashboard-
Under this project ,I did some of the listed things:
◈ Loading data into Power BI and cleaning it with Power Query
◈ Creating HR metrics like headcount, avg. leave balance, avg. salary etc. with Power Pivot
◈ Adding columns to the data (like Employee's first name, age group etc.)
◈ Finding relationships between salary and education qualification
◈ Using visual filters to see top / bottom paid staff in each job
◈ Customizing visuals in Power BI (changing colours, axis, labels and legend)
◈ Advanced DAX calculations like cumulative headcount, leave balance more than 20 days 
◈ Designing a monthly HR dashboard with Power BI
◈ Working with "NEW" card visual in Power BI


Steps followed while creating this dashboard;

1) How many people are in each job?
2) Gender break-down of the staff
3) Age spread of the staff
4) Which jobs pay more?
5) Top earners in each job
6) Qualification vs. Salary
7) Staff growth trend over time
8) Employee filter by starting letter
9) Leave balance analysis
10) Quick HR Dashboard
